# UTCM
We conducted experiments using the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) framework on several NVIDIA A800 80G GPUs. The environment configuration is consistent with LLaMA-Factory. The code is primarily divided into two parts: an entry script (.sh files) and model configuration files (.yaml files). The entry script is located in the main directory, while the configuration files are stored under the path [./Configs](./Configs), including [./Configs/pt](./Configs/pt),  [./Configs/sft](./Configs/sft) and [./Configs/predict](./Configs/predict), which are used for incremental pretraining ,supervised fine-tuning and testing(predicting), respectively. Additionally, some of the test(predict) configuration files are also placed under [./Configs/sft](./Configs/sft).
