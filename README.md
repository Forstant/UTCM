# UTCM
We conducted experiments using the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) framework on several NVIDIA A800 80G GPUs. The environment configuration is consistent with LLaMA-Factory. The code is primarily divided into two parts: an entry script (bash file) and model configuration files (.yaml files). The entry script is located in the main directory, while the configuration files are stored under the path ./config, including ./config/pt and ./config/sft, which are used for incremental pretraining and supervised fine-tuning, respectively. Additionally, the test configuration files are also placed under ./config/sft.
